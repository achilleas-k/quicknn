# QuickNN
Simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network in Python, trained using back-propagation.
The "quick" in the name signifies the speed with which it was written and should not be misunderstood for the efficiency or speed of the program.
It might serve as the basis for a more comprehensive library in the future, but for now, it's quite basic.

This was written some time ago (a couple of years) and hasn't been thoroughly tested, so there's no guarantee that it works properly.
It certainly finds good solutions, so it's doing something right.
